# WeWeb - Build user interfaces on top of databases

WeWeb is visual app-development platform where you can build user interfaces on top of your databases.

I’ve started helping out WeWeb in May of 2022 as their first dedicated designer and my job in the editor was to polish design, think and create new features and challenge the core principles of the software.

Outside of the editor we wanted to improve our visibility on social media and achieve growth with a website.

## Components
The next big thing

Ever since WeWeb came to existence in current version, the most requested feature was classes. Users coming from Webflow and code were very familiar with this and so they requested for this feature. For a long time the only reason for not implementing this was complexity and development time.

But as time went by, the product team was less and less convinced that this will be a good solution. When starting to use Webflow, classes felt like a natural and clean way to handling styles without code, but it quickly became very tiring to name classes and plan the styles. 

So we thought about something a bit different - implementing components as seen in Figma and Framer.

Components are reusable blocks in their simplest form, but you can go very far with them. WeWeb always tries to be as close to the code as possible and this is why our components have properties, internal variables and triggers.

In exploration, we went a step further and played with something called page components which are very similar to layouts in popular frameworks today. With page components you could quickly add alert system to all of your pages or change the top navigation to a side menu. 

## Workflow editor
The next big thing

One of the first things I worked with the WeWeb team is the workflow editor. This is something that hasn’t existed previously and it limited users ability to create complex actions with branching.

The result is the editor in which you can choose from plenty of prebuilt actions, splits and even custom code. Users can visually track the decision flow of the action and even test it.

## Website
Building a good website takes time

In August of 2022, we began the process of redesigning and rebuilding our website. We released a first version of the site that month, but it was not up to our desired standards due to our decision not to prioritize the brand's identity. 

A month later, we made significant improvements by cutting pages that did not meet our quality standards and redesigning the home page. Tracking conversions closely, we made additional changes to the design and content of the site, leading to an increase in conversions. 

However, we continued to strive for improvement and conducted another redesign of the home page. The new version of the website was finally released in January 2023 and we believe it now meets the standards of a startup website.

## Typography
Playing it safe
<Image src={testPic} alt="Picture of the author" className={styles.image}/>

One of the main trends that we observed at WeWeb is that our identity appeared fun and playful. However, as the company's focus shifted towards developing web applications and attracting a wider range of clients, including enterprises, we wanted to update our image to be more modern and functional. As a result, we decided to use Inter as our typography, which is a popular choice for the web today.

In the future, our goal is to incorporate elements of our original identity through the use of typography, while still maintaining a professional image.

The styles in our design follow a simple scale, with headings ranging from one to six on an almost linear scale. For most of the user interface, we use four sizes (10, 12, 14, and 16 pixels) in regular and medium weight, with equal line height.

One factor to consider when comparing Figma and the final product is that Figma uses a custom rendering engine that includes font smoothing, which is similar to anti-aliasing on the web. In our current implementation, we do not use this smoothing, which can result in a slight difference in appearance compared to the designs. However, anti-aliased fonts tend to appear slimmer, so it is necessary to adjust and use the different weights accordingly.

## Refreshing the colors
With a color refresh due, we’ve decided to make some quick improvements until we have the time to this properly. The result is improved contrast and a darker and cleaner dark mode.

WeWeb has a built-in dark mode feature that inverts the color ramps. While this is an easy solution, it can sometimes result in low contrast issues with certain elements. Additionally, using color ramps can lead to design debt, as the colors do not have semantic value.

To address these issues, we are implementing color tokens. Derived from the ramps, these tokens are named based on their function, allowing for more customization and control. For example, you can customize text, background, or other colors in any color mode without affecting other tokens with the same value. This approach is inspired by the way Figma handles their colors, as described in this talk.

## Icons
With previously using FA icons, we were looking for something more modern and polished. After a lot of time looking at different sets, we've landed on heroicons(v1). However, we wanted more control over icons on the core parts of the interface like the styling sidebar which is why I spent a lot of time creating custom icons for these sections. Using 1.5px stroke on 20px size achieves perfect balance of visibility and elegance.

## Academy
WeWeb Academy is an app where people can learn and improve their skills. After designing the interface, I’ve built it with WeWeb itself and XANO.

It tracks user’ progress and lets you watch courses that teach you how to build an app from zero.
