# Simply buy, sell and securely store cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin Store is the largest cryptocurrency wallet in SE Europe. In 2021, they wanted to improve their online presence by redesigning their web application and website. Joined by another designer we've spent the year doing just that and the redesign launched in late 2021. Business was growing and the decision to also redesign the mobile app came. The current app was scarce in features that are available on the web application and with even more changes such as ability to have FIAT accounts and cards coming, it was due.

The visual identity was already created in the web app redesign, but there was space for improvement. Starting with the orange color which had contrast issue, it was adjusted to be more modern and accessible. Another topic was using non-white desatured backgrounds which distracted users from the interface focus points. We've pivoted to using a clear white background with minimal separation and unecessary use of cards.

## Navigation and home
Big discussion point was what to put on the home and how to organize the navigation.

After many interations and discussions it was clear that the home should primarily serve to inform users of it's portfolio and value. News and other cryptocurrency details were placed under a 'Market' tab, a prominent icon for executing actions such as buying and selling was added in the middle and the newly added 'Accounts' with 'Profile' were the last two.
