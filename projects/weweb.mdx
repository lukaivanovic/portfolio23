        # Build user interfaces on top of databases

        WeWeb is visual app-development platform where you can build user interfaces on top of your databases. I’ve started working with the WeWeb team in May of 2022 as their first dedicated designer and my job in the editor was to polish design, think and create new features and challenge the core principles of the software.

        Outside of the editor we wanted to improve our visibility on social media and achieve growth with the marketing website.

        ## Components
        
        Ever since WeWeb came to existence in current version, the most requested feature was classes. For a long time the only reason for not implementing this was complexity and development time.

        Over time, the team has become less convinced that classes would be the best solution. While they may seem like a natural and clean way to handle styles without code, the process of naming classes and planning styles can become tedious.

        So we thought about something a bit different - implementing components as seen in Figma and Framer.

        Components are reusable blocks in their simplest form, but you can go very far with them. WeWeb tries to be as close to the code as possible and this is why our components have properties, internal variables and triggers alike the ones in popular frameworks. 

        <Image src={img13} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>

        In exploration, we went a step further and played with something called Page components. With Page components you could quickly add alert system to all of your pages or change the top navigation to a side menu.

        ## Workflow editor
        Achieve complex logic with branching and easily preview your logic

        One of the first things I worked with the WeWeb team is the workflow editor. This is something that hasn’t existed previously and it limited users ability to create complex actions with branching.

        The result is the editor in which you can choose from plenty of prebuilt actions, splits and custom code. Users can visually track the decision flow of the action and test it.
        
        <Image src={img20} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>

        One of the things that we did previously is give names to every action created e.g Action 1.1, Action 1.2. With this release we changes this and an action no longer requires a name. If it doesn’t have one the main title will be action type. If it does one it takes the main title and the action type and contextual information is in the second line.

        ## Website
        Building a good website takes time

        In August of 2022, we began the process of redesigning and rebuilding our website. We released a first version of the site the same month, but it had not turned out to our expectations. In retrospect, the biggest mistake we made was to not take a direction with the identity. The result was that the website felt generic. 

        A month later, we made significant improvements by cutting pages that did not meet our quality standards and redesigning the home page. Tracking conversions closely, we made additional changes to the design and content of the site, leading to an increase in conversions. 
        <Image src={img10} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        However, we continued to strive for improvement and conducted another redesign of the home page. The new version of the website was finally released in January 2023 and we believe it now meets the standards of a good marketing website.

        ## Typography
        Playing it safe

        One of the main trends that we observed at WeWeb is that our identity appeared fun and playful. However, as the company's focus shifted towards developing web applications and attracting a wider range of clients, including enterprises, we wanted to update our image to be more modern and functional. As a result, we decided to use Inter as our typography, which is a popular choice for the web today.

        In the future, our goal is to incorporate elements of our original identity through the use of typography, while still maintaining a professional image.

        The styles in our design follow a simple scale, with headings ranging from one to six on an almost linear scale. 
        <Image src={img6} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        For most of the user interface, we use four sizes (10, 12, 14, and 16 pixels) in regular and medium weight.
        <Image src={img7} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        One factor to consider when comparing Figma and the final product is that Figma uses a custom rendering engine that includes font smoothing, which is similar to anti-aliasing on the web. In our current implementation, we do not use this smoothing, which can result in a slight difference in appearance compared to the designs. However, anti-aliased fonts tend to appear slimmer, so it is necessary to adjust and use the different weights accordingly.

    <div className={styles.content}>
        <Image src={img2} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        ## Refreshing the colors
        With a color refresh due, we’ve decided to make some quick improvements until we have the time to this properly. The result is improved contrast and a darker and cleaner dark mode.
        <Image src={img19} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        WeWeb has a built-in dark mode feature that inverts the color ramps. While this is an easy solution, it can sometimes result in low contrast issues with certain elements. Additionally, using color ramps can lead to design debt, as the colors do not have semantic value.
        <Image src={img1} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        To address these issues, we are implementing color tokens. Derived from the ramps, these tokens are named based on their function, allowing for more customization and control. For example, you can customize text, background, or other colors in any color mode without affecting other tokens with the same value.
        <Image src={img18} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        This approach is inspired by the way Figma handles their colors, as described in <a href="https://youtu.be/1DTnojio89Y">this talk</a>.

        ## Icons
        With previously using FA icons, we were looking for something more modern and polished. After a lot of time looking at different sets, we've landed on heroicons.
        <Image src={img22} alt="Project shot" width = "1920" height = "1152" className={styles.image} placeholder="blur" quality="100"/>
        However, we wanted more control over icons on the core parts of the interface like the styling sidebar which is why I spent a lot of time creating custom icons for these sections. Using 1.5px stroke on 20px size achieves perfect balance of visibility and elegance.
